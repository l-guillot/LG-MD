###Topic Explanations
I write these explanations from memory to help reinforce concepts (รก la physicist Richard Feynman's technique)

##Marfan Syndrome

This ==autosomal dominant== (pass to ~75% pyrogyny) condition is caused by a splice site mutation--an error in the genetic code that results in an error in the step of mRNA processing in which introns are removed from the sequence--that messes up expression of the FBR1 gene on chromosome 15, which encodes the glycoprotein fibrillin-1. The function of normal fibrillin-1 is to form the structure of elastin, and also plays an important part in sequestering TGF-beta. Fibrillin is the scaffolding that tropoelastin residues (chains of non-hydroxylated Pro, Ser, and Lys residues) are built on to create the structure of elastin. Without the normal function of fibrillin-1, the body cannot make appropriate amounts of structural proteins to constitute elastic tissues. Many organs in the body depend on their elastic characteristics for their physiological function; the lungs, arteries, elastic cartilage, the skin. Additionally, the loss of fibrillin-1's function in relation to TGF-beta causes deficits in other cellular functions, resulting in problems with long bone development. Clinical presentation:

long limbs and fingers (arachnodactyly)
vertical dislocation of the lens on the sclera
cystic medial necrosis of the aorta
aortic root dissection or dislocation (will cause chest pain radiating to the shoulder)
increased risk for spontaneous pneumothorax
Note: Marfan syndrome does not cause intellectual disability.

##Homocystinuria

Methionine <-- methionine synthase + B12 -- Methionine --Homocystine synthase + Ser + B6--> Homocystine --B6--> Cystine

Homocystinuria can result from defects in any of the steps in the above pathways. All of these different mechanisms are autosomal recessive (~25% pyrogyny, can skip generations). Each of the different mechanisms can be treated with supplementation of the missing substrates. Clinical presentation:

Marfanoid habitus (see above)
Intellectual disability
